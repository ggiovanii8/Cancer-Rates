WHERE [Group] = 1;
```
</pre>

Loaded the dataset 'p65chemicallist'. Dataset that displays chemicals that have been studied. Shows us what chemicals are cancerous and which are developmental, meaning that the chemical can lead to cancer after a certain amount of exposure.

```sql
SELECT TOP (1000) [STATE OF CALIFORNIA]
      ,[F2]
      ,[F3]
      ,[F4]
      ,[F5]

--Checking to see if it worked
   
SELECT
    [STATE OF CALIFORNIA] AS Chemical,
    [F2] AS [Type of Toxicity]
FROM [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[p65chemicalslist$];
   
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Created the new table with an increased column length
   
CREATE TABLE [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Cancerous_Chemicals] (
    Chemical VARCHAR(500), -- or a higher value
    [Type of Toxicity] VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Inserted the selected data into a new table
   
INSERT INTO [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Cancerous_Chemicals] (Chemical, [Type of Toxicity])
SELECT
    [STATE OF CALIFORNIA] AS Chemical,
    [F2] AS [Type of Toxicity]
FROM [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[p65chemicalslist$];
```
</pre>

Going to filter out only the cancerous chemicals from the column titled, 'Type of Toxicity' and create a new table named, 'Cancerous_Chemicals2'

```sql
ELECT TOP (1000) [Chemical]
      ,[Type of Toxicity]
  FROM [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Cancerous_Chemicals]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--filtering out only the cancerous chemicals
	
SELECT [Chemical], [Type of Toxicity]
INTO [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Filtered_Cancerous_Chemicals]
FROM [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Cancerous_Chemicals]
WHERE [Type of Toxicity] = 'cancer';

--making a new table for the cancerous chemicals

SELECT *
INTO [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Cancerous_Chemicals2]
FROM [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Carcinogenic];
```
</pre>

I filtered unique carcinogenic substances. 

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT [Carcinogenic_Substance]
INTO [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Carcinogenic_Distinct]
FROM [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Carcinogenic]
```
</pre>

Finding any values in the 'Carcinogenic_Substance' column of the 'Carcinogenic' table match with values in the 'Chemical' column of the 'Chemical_AllYears' table.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.Carcinogenic_Substance
FROM Carcinogenic c
INNER JOIN Chemical_AllYears ca ON c.Carcinogenic_Substance = ca.Chemical;
```
</pre>

Created a new table named 'Matching_Chemicals' to store the chemicals that match between the 'Carcinogenic' table and the 'Chemical_AllYears' table. I wanted to match them based on the 'Carcinogenic_Substance' column in the 'Carcinogenic' table and the 'Chemical' column in the 'Chemical_AllYears' table.

```sql
-- Create the new table
	
CREATE TABLE [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Matching_Chemicals] (
    [Chemical] VARCHAR(255) -- Change the data type if needed
);

-- Insert matching chemicals from the Carcinogenic table into the new table
INSERT INTO [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Matching_Chemicals] ([Chemical])
SELECT ca.[Chemical]
FROM [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Carcinogenic] car
JOIN [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Chemical_AllYears] ca ON car.[Carcinogenic_Substance] = ca.[Chemical];
```
</pre>

After isolating Group 1 carcinogenic chemicals through careful filtering of various datasets, my next step involves the creation of a new table that presents these Group 1 carcinogenic chemicals alongside the corresponding commodities onto which they were applied. This table will also provide insights into the quantities of these chemicals used, measured in pounds, as well as the frequency of their application in terms of the number of applications.

```sql
--Creating Permament Table

CREATE VIEW [dbo].[Toxic_Chemicals_on_Commodities]
AS
SELECT cac.Chemical, cac.Commodity, cac.Pounds, cac.Num_Apps, cac.Area_treated
FROM [Chemical_And_Commodity_2016_2021] cac
INNER JOIN [Matching_Chemicals] mc ON cac.Chemical = mc.Chemical;
```
</pre>

Summarized view of the total pounds, total number of applications, and total area treated for each chemical-commodity combination.\

```sql
SELECT Chemical, Commodity, SUM(Pounds) AS Total_Pounds, SUM(Num_Apps) AS Total_Num_Apps, SUM(Area_treated) AS Total_Area_treated
FROM [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Toxic_Chemicals_on_Commodities]
GROUP BY Chemical, Commodity;

--Creating Permament Table

CREATE VIEW [dbo].[Sum_Chem_Comm]
AS
SELECT Chemical, Commodity, SUM(Pounds) AS Total_Pounds, SUM(Num_Apps) AS Total_Num_Apps, SUM(Area_treated) AS Total_Area_treated
FROM [Cancer_Study].[dbo].[Toxic_Chemicals_on_Commodities]
GROUP BY Chemical, Commodity;
```

# Conclusion 
Pesticides find extensive application in agriculture, various occupational settings, and homes. A subset of the chemicals present in pesticides has been associated with cancer based on findings from laboratory experiments and epidemiological studies. Nevertheless, definitive proof connecting overall pesticide usage to cancer remains inconclusive.

The diverse array of chemicals found in pesticides, combined with potential contributing factors to cancer among individuals exposed to these substances, renders it challenging to definitively establish direct connections between pesticide usage and cancer occurrences. Simultaneously, the available evidence is inadequate to conclusively ascertain the absence of any relationship between cancer and exposure to pesticides, whether through direct chemical contact or residual interactions.
